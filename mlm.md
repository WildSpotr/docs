# Machine Learning Model (MLM) for WildSpotr

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather a dataset of images containing various wildlife species. You can use online repositories or collect your own images.
   - Each image should be labeled with the corresponding species.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Resize the images to a uniform size to ensure consistency.
   - Normalize the pixel values to a standard range (e.g., 0 to 1).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - Design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. CNNs are commonly used for image classification tasks.
   - Start with a simple architecture, such as a few convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers.
   - Experiment with different architectures to improve performance.

4. **Training**:
   - Train the model using the training dataset.
   - Use techniques like data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting.
   - Monitor the model's performance on the validation set and adjust hyperparameters accordingly.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset to assess its performance.
   - Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model's effectiveness.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a wildlife spotting application.
   - Users can upload images of wildlife they spot, and the model will classify the species.
   - Provide feedback to users on the accuracy of the classification.

7. **Improvement**:
   - Continuously collect feedback from users and update the model to improve its accuracy and performance.
   - Consider using techniques like transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models and fine-tune them for your specific task.
